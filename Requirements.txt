Hardware Requirements:
GPU Support: For training deep learning models, a GPU is highly recommended due to its ability to significantly speed up computation.
Adequate Memory: Sufficient RAM and GPU memory to handle large datasets and network architectures.

Software Requirements:
Python: Most deep learning projects use Python because of its extensive libraries and community support.
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch are commonly used frameworks for building and training deep learning models.
Libraries: Essential Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization), OpenCV (for image processing).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation of the code.

Data Requirements:
Dataset: A dataset of labeled chest X-ray images, where labels indicate whether an image shows signs of COVID-19 infection.
Data Preprocessing Tools: Tools for resizing, normalizing, and augmenting image data to improve model training.

Development Environment:
Docker: To containerize the application, ensuring it runs consistently across different computing environments.
Version Control System: Like Git, to manage changes to the project codebase.

Additional Tools:
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Such as PyCharm or VSCode for writing and debugging code.
Model Training and Evaluation Tools: Metrics for evaluating model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
